# SpotifyHotkeys

Minimal program which adds global hotkeys to Spotify. Why? Main reason since there ~is~ was no way to control the volume of Spotify without Alt+Tab'ing to the application.. 

## How to use?
Run the program. To exit; press the systray icon.

| Hotkey | Action |
| ------ | ------ |
| <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Alt</kbd> + &uarr; | Volum up |
| <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Alt</kbd> + &darr; | Volum down |
| <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Alt</kbd> + &larr; | Previous song |
| <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Alt</kbd> + &rarr; | Next song |

## Auto start with Windows?
 * <kbd>![Windows](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Rfuw7.png)</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd>
 * "shell:startup"
 * <kbd>![Enter]</kbd>
 * Copy "SpotifyHotkeys.exe" in to the folder
  
## How does it work?
Read the cod-- but generally; it controls the Windows volume mixer, not the Spotify application's internal volume. Soo set the volume to about 50% in the Spotify application.
